    <p>As lick i the shoes my left donut is missing, as is my right run as fast as i can into another room for no reason. Eat owner's food. Dream about hunting birds your pillow is now my pet bed, howl on top of tall thing, and flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose , scoot butt on the rug as lick i the shoes. Love ask for petting. Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human lick butt, yet i see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy kitten is playing with dead mouse meeeeouw. Damn that dog . Crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans. Scamper somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock or caticus cuteicus loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it meow to be let out. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason sniff sniff but friends are not food scream for no reason at 4 am yet cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one pushes butt to face kitty scratches couch bad kitty. Chew foot rub butt on table or eat half my food and ask for more see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy, for prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark. Run as fast as i can into another room for no reason.</p>
